<p class="mb-4">Dharmarao Shikshan Mandal Aheri was established by late Shrimant Raje Vishweshwarrao Maharaj in 1958 to impart the quality education to the Naxal-affected, tribal, rural students of this area. He pointed out that the students of this area are talented and sincere. They are deprived of just chances. He established the society to bring the students of this area into the main stream of the nation. He noticed that education is the only force which not only make them aware of the world but make them capable to serve the nation. </p>
